Also the donation is given even if the pause button is on

Attached are the other more aesthetic design changes. I've spent some time really thinking about this and I think we should go with the following design decisions:

- White Lightbox not black, more user friendly 
- ADS FOR GOOD not Good-Loop I don't think our logo is strong enough to grab attention. ADS FOR GOOD makes an immediate statement that's different from another logo, another brand, another ad. I know you said the font is too heavy, so I've made them as pngs (attached). 
- Solid colours in the unit, not fade, it's more contemporary.  
- On the banner, on hover the play button should make a subtle shadow to help communicate that you're clicking-to-play

<h3>medium-rectangle</h3>

<h3>mobile</h3>
